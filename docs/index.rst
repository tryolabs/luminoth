`Luminoth <https://luminoth.ai>`_ is an open source toolkit for computer vision.
Currently, we support object detection, but we are aiming for much more. It's
built in Python, using `TensorFlow <https://tensorflow.org>`_ and `Sonnet
<https://github.com/deepmind/sonnet>`_.

The code is open source and `available on GitHub
<https://github.com/tryolabs/luminoth>`_.
