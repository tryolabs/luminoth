    RPNAnchorTarget

    TODO: (copied) Assign anchors to ground-truth targets. Produces anchor
    classification labels and bounding-box regression targets.

    Detailed responsabilities:
    - Keep anchors that are inside the image.
    - We need to set each anchor with a label:
        1 is positive
            when GT overlap is >= 0.7 or for GT max overlap (one anchor)
        0 is negative
            when GT overlap is < 0.3
        -1 is don't care
            useful for subsampling negative labels

    - Create BBox targets with anchors and GT.
        TODO:
        Cual es la diferencia entre bbox_inside_weights y bbox_outside_weights


    Things to take into account:
    - We can assign "don't care" labels to anchors we want to ignore in batch.


    Returns:
        labels: label for each anchor
        bbox_targets: bbox regresion values for each anchor
        bbox_inside_weights: TODO: ??
