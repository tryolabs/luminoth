class RCNNProposal(snt.AbstractModule):
    """Create final object detection proposals.

    RCNNProposals takes the proposals generated by the RPN and the predictions
    of the RCNN (both classification and boundin box adjusting) and generates
    a list of object proposals with assigned class.

    In the process it tries to remove duplicated suggestions by applying non
    maximum suppresion (NMS).

    We apply NMS because the way object detectors are usually scored is by
    treating duplicated detections (multiple detections that overlap the same
    ground truth value) as false positive. It is resonable to assume that there
    may exist such case that applying NMS is completly unnecesary.

    Besides applying NMS it also filters the top N results, both for classes
    and in general. These values are easily modifiable in the configuration
    files.
